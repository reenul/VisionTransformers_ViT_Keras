# Vision Transformers ViT Keras
Vision Transformer ViT model used in agricultural application using K-Fold Cross Validation

In this repository, the code used to load and train Keras Vision Transformer and CNN-based models using a K-Fold cross validation technique leaving p-out is presented.
The models used were pre-trained on the ImageNet datasets. 
The image dataset used is also presented, categorised in 5 classes: weeds, beet (red leaves), off-type beet (green leaves), parsley and spinach.  

The image dataset directory is to be organised as follows:
